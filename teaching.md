In 2016 and 17 I helped teach the Systems Neuroscience course for graduate students at Harvard [name](website).

In 2015 and 16 I was a curriculum coordinator and lecturer for the [Native American High School Summer Program](http://dms.hms.harvard.edu/diversity/summer/NAHSSP.html). This is a a three-week summer program for high school students from participating Native reservations. Students, teachers, and community representatives come to Harvard Medical School to learn about the science of substance abuse and addiction.

From 2012-15 I was a mentor, curriculum coordinator and lecturer for the [Health Professions Recruitment Exposure Program (HPREP)](https://hprep.wordpress.com/) at Harvard Medical School.

I've also lectured for various outreach programs including, [Beacon Hill Seminars](https://www.beaconhillseminars.org/), [Science in the News](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/) and [Science Works].
