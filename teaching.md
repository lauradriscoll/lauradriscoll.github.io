I taught the Dynamical Systems and RNNs interactive tutorials for [TReND school in Computational Neuroscience and Machine Learning Basics](https://github.com/trendinafrica/Comp_Neuro-ML_course) in Ghana, 2023. This was an intensive two-week entry level course to teach African students and young researchers the basics of computational neuroscience and machine learning. My lectures were heavily inspired by [Bing Brunton's Neuromatch Academy linear dynamical systems lecture/tutorial](https://compneuro.neuromatch.io/tutorials/W2D2_LinearSystems/student/W2D2_Tutorial1.html) and [Steve Brunton's intro to dynamics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VBN_dJZLWc&ab_channel=InstituteforPure%26AppliedMathematics%28IPAM%29).

I co-taught a neuroscience techniques survey course [(NBIO 227) at Stanford in 2020](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=NBIO+227%3a+Understanding+Techniques+in+Neuroscience&view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&academicYear=20202021).

In 2016-17 I helped teach the Systems Neuroscience course for graduate students at Harvard Medical School [Neurobiology 204](https://github.com/lauradriscoll/nb204).

In 2015-16 I was a curriculum coordinator and lecturer for the [Native American High School Summer Program](http://dms.hms.harvard.edu/diversity/summer/NAHSSP.html). This is a a three-week summer program for high school students from participating Native reservations. Students, teachers, and community representatives come to Harvard Medical School to learn about the science of substance abuse and addiction.

From 2012-15 I was a mentor, curriculum coordinator and lecturer for the [Health Professions Recruitment Exposure Program (HPREP)](https://hprep.wordpress.com/) at Harvard Medical School.

I've also lectured for various outreach programs including, [Beacon Hill Seminars](https://www.beaconhillseminars.org/), [Science in the News](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/) and Science Works.
