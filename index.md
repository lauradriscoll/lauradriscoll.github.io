[[CV]](/pdfs/Academic_CV.pdf)

I'm a postdoc with Krishna V. Shenoy and David Sussillo in the [Neural Prosthetic Systems Laboratory (NPSL)](https://shenoy.people.stanford.edu/overview) at [Stanford University](https://neuroscience.stanford.edu/). I'm interested in neural population dynamics in the context of learning and memory in cortical networks. How do ensembles of neurons balance flexibility and robustness for new and previously learned computations?

I did my graduate research with [Chris Harvey](http://harveylab.hms.harvard.edu/) at [Harvard University](https://www.hms.harvard.edu/dms/neuroscience/). I studied neural dynamics in cortical networks of mice performing decision-making tasks in virtual reality. We tracked neural correlates of learned associations during and after learning.
