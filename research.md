Here, you can find some more details on research projects I am involved in, as well as some code repositories we have made available

#### __Sparse Variational GPFA (svGPFA)__
In this project, we developed a sparse extension of [GPFA](http://jn.physiology.org/content/102/1/614.long) using inducing points. Our method does not only circumvent the cubic complexity of standard GPFA but also makes it easy to work with non-conjugate likelihoods, like a point-process likelihood for spike-time data. Thus, a point-process extension of svGPFA operates directly on spike times and in continuous time, hence removing the need to bin spike times into discrete counts falling into time bins of a fixed chosen width.

Python and Matlab code is available here: <https://github.com/UCL/PP-SVGPFA>

#### __Scalable Inference for STRFs with low-rank Structure (VLR)__
In this project, we developed a scalable method for Bayesian inference in spatio-temporal receptive fields. The method improves on the cubic scaling of standard *maximum a posteriori* inference and allows for improved receptive field estimation in settings with very large and correlated stimuli and under limited number of samples.
